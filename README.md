# Camera Timeline Project

A security camera timeline interface that displays events across multiple cameras with an interactive scrubber for time navigation.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Database:** NeonDB (PostgreSQL)
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## ‚è≥ If I Had More Time...

I would have worked on the following enhancements:

- **Synchronize video playback with the timeline scrubber**, enabling real-time seeking and play/pause controls that stay in sync.
- **Display dynamic camera incidents from the database**, showing live events on the timeline with filtering and search functionality.
- **Enhance the timeline with zoom levels**, event bookmarks, and interactive popups for detailed event information.
